## Brentwood Elections

1. The borough of Brentwood is in Essex, England.   It sits just outside London, and is mostly bordered on the West
side by the M25 ring road.
2. Elections for the Borough Council are held three out of every four years (the fourth year is for Essex County Council)
3. This Coursera project uses the election data to produce graphs of the election results.

## The application.

I have compiled a set of data for the local election results held in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014 (the County Council elections were held in 2013).   This is used as the basis of the presentation.  The data is in CSV format and is
easily loaded.
```{r loaddata}
electiondata <- read.csv("BrentwoodElections.csv", header=TRUE)
head(electiondata)
```
This shows each ward, the year of the election, the candidate, party and total votes cast.
